During week three I furthered my understanding of installing WordPress by creating a local environment. I had done this before and brushed up on my understanding of WordPress and how it functions. The first step I took was to install MAMP, which is a freeware that combines MYSQL server, PHPmyadmin interface to manage MYSQL and an Apache webserver. Once this was installed I tested if the mamp localhost
URL worked. If a webpage loads using localhost this indicates that the local development environment is working correctly. 

The challenge I face was connecting my WordPress to the database. I followed the steps provided, which required me to create a database first.
Using the PHPmyadmin interface I created a database name and saved it. Next, I had to edit the wp-config, PHP file in the WordPress working folder
to update the database name. The default username and password for my MYSQL was root and created by the developers of MAMP.

I had to watch a few tutorials that helped me solve the problem which was on the port number. There was a similar port that was being used by another application. I had to investigate which port was free for the MYSQL and managed to find port 3008. 
Once WordPress was up and running I started to develop my websites by first creating the pages followed by a menu. The content I used was from last weeks Joomla practical. I was used to using the classical editor in WordPress and disabled the new Gutenberg editor which
is not that intuitive and easy to use. 

I enjoyed working with WordPress CMS than Joomla. I would prefer to continue using WordPress in my first assignment.
