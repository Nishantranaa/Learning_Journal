This week I watched a video from youtube and learnt how to deploy a wordpress website. 
I used AWS and setup up an instance which helped me setup Joomla and Wordpress in one click.
This was the easy way then deploying a local environment. 

In AWS is used Lightsail to install both CMS. Below are in the links below.

AWS has assigned me a public IP address: 52.63.193.243, this will be used to access my site.

Learning - Logging into the wordpress site I have to use the wp-login.php after my IP address. 
To use the pre installed plugins and installing one. I used a free theme that was attractive and easy to customize. 
During the week 5 class I helped a class mate on trying to solve a glitch on her Joomla site. The problem was that the 
menu was not appearing on the website but was appearing on the frontend whilst editing the site. 

To solve this better we used teamviewer and I was able to try a few troubleshooting methods. The first was disabling active 
plugins one by one and reloading the page to identify if it was a plugin issue. This was helpful in identifing that the plugin called 
nice page was conflicting with the default Joomla theme. There was two solutions; first would be to update the theme. Which may resolve any 
bugs in the current version. The use another option was to stick with the default features. 

A bit of read online via the nicepage forum revealed that many user are facing the same issue. The link is https://nicepage.

The last resort was to export the current updates and reinstall the theme.
