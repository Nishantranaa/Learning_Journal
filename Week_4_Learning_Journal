This week I watched a video from youtube and learnt how to deploy a wordpress website. 
I used AWS and setup up an instance which helped me setup Joomla and Wordpress in one click.
This was the easy way then deploying a local environment. 

In AWS is used Lightsail to install both CMS. Below are in the links below.

AWS has assigned me a public IP address: 52.63.193.243, this will be used to access my site.

Learning - Logging into the wordpress site I have to use the wp-login.php after my IP address. 
To use the pre installed plugins and installing one. I used a free theme that was attractive and easy to customize.
