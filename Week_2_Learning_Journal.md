Learning_Journal_Weekly_Insights

This week I was tasked to interview class members and find out more about their characters. This helped me build a rapport with members of my group. I got to meet a new face by the name Jiaxin Li and would love for him to be part of my team. During this class, I had helped Davide and Jiaxin Li on installing Joomla via their AWS Free Tier account. Randhir had generously shared his findings on a frontend Joomla editor plugin branded as Nicepage! It was worth trying it out for a better-looking website. 

Installing Joomla requires us to SSH into a Debian server. I learnt how to create a private key as a .ppk and .pem file which is used to authenticate access into the Linux server securely using SSH 
and a got to learn and use putty. 

Joomla is a content management system and great for blogging. The user interface is easy to use but I particularly found it a bit of a 
challenge to create menus and prefer more intuitive WordPress. Another challenge was figuring out how to link a menu button to
a page. 

The concept which I have come up for my start-up would be a software which can processing physical documents using technology such as NLP and OCR and help organisations process applications at a quicker pace.
